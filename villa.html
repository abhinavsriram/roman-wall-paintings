      The wall paintings in this cubiculum (bedroom) that you just explored in the 3D model are executed in the true fresco technique, and are among the most complete wall paintings to have survived from antiquity. The room has been reconstructed at the Met in New York City to give an impression of its original appearance as it was present in the villa. It is this reconstruction that you explored in the model. 
      <br><br>
      The modern mosaic floor is based on photographs and descriptions recorded soon after the villa was uncovered in the 1900s. 
      <br><br>
      The three-dimensional moldings above the frescoes suggest the kind of stuccowork that usually completed the decoration of such rooms. Their design and placement are based on early photographs of the room itself as well as on the stuccowork in a similar bedroom located in a nearby villa. 
      <br><br>
      The room always had a window at the far end which appears over exposed in the model. 
      <br><br>
      The walls create a fuller illusion of spatial depth than any other known frescoes of the period and are thus considered an exceptional example of the fully mature Second Style. They are divided into three main areas, each with a different subject. 
      <br><br>
      The side walls near the entrance show a podium on which rest low walls with three closed entrances. The central gate leads into a tree-filled sanctuary, surrounded by high walls and terraced buildings. Under an elaborate pylon stands a bronze statue of a goddess. Houses rise behind the magnificent portals at the sides. The shield with the Macedonian star that hangs from the lintel evokes royal precincts, while the theatrical masks that flank it bring to mind Hellenistic stage sets. 
      <br><br>
      The area at the rear of the room with the vaulted ceiling was reserved for the bed. The side walls of the sleeping alcove include a round temple just visible behind sanctuary walls. The back wall opens onto an outdoor scene. A dark cave recedes behind a fountain, while on the rocks above, an arbor stretches back into the distance.
